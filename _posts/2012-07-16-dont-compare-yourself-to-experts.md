In early 2002, I started taking guitar lessons from [Chris Broderick](). To say that's he a good guitar player would be a massive understatement. Guitar, like many skills, has a steep learning curve. In my opinion, it takes 3 years of consistent practice just to be a bad guitar player. I had started playing guitar a couple years before, so I wasn't any good.

I arrived for my first lesson with Chris extremely nervous and unsure of myself. As we got started, I couldn't seem to warm up and play fluidly. Here I was sitting in front of a certified bad-ass, someone whom I could never hope to impress even on my best day, and my fingers were locking up and I was botching simple riffs that I had played thousands of times. I felt like the least-skilled guitar player ever, and I was convinced that I was the worst student Chris had ever had.

Chris, having spent many years as both a teacher and a student (he was still talking classical and flamenco lessons, and probably still is), could tell what was happening. He knew I was nervous and had probably seen it before with other students. We discussed my goals and set out with a plan to accomplish them. Chris demonstrated a few things on his guitar that melted my brain, things that I could never conceive of being able to perform, and he did it with the appearance of effortlessness. I left that lesson extremely humbled and wondering if I should take voice lessons instead.

I was discouraged, but for entirely invalid reasons. I was comparing myself to a master (though he would probably point to others and claim that they were masters, not he). He was synthesizing years of relentless practice and learning and my window into that was eight seconds of ridiculous speed and precision as he shredded another seemingly impossible lick. I didn't get to see the ten hour days spent practicing modes, scales, and atonal finger independence exercises. I couldn't see the 4 years of music school. I had no sense of him struggling with something. I was confusing years of diligent effort for natural talent. I was looking at a picture of a forest without being able to count the trees from which it had grown.
