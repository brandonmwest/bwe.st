Last month I attended [php|tek](http://voicesoftheelephpant.com/2012/06/26/its-the-booze-talking-episode-03-apis/ "php|tek") in Chicago, 
and was lucky enough to participate in a liquor-fueled, API-focused discussion with a bunch of super smart people, which was recorded
for the [Voices of the Elephpant](http://http://voicesoftheelephpant.com/) podcast. That discussion is now available - [check it out!](http://voicesoftheelephpant.com/2012/06/26/its-the-booze-talking-episode-03-apis/)
