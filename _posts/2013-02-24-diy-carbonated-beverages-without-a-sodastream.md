Sparkling water is one of my favorite drinks; it's refreshing, it makes
you burp, and it can be used for cocktails and cooking. I looked into
getting a Sodastream system but I really don't like the business model.
It's basically the disposable razor blade model where the upfront cost
is low but the lifetime cost is high, and the profit is made on the
refills.

I knew about the
[Carbonater](http://www.amazon.com/LiquidBread-The-Carbonater/dp/B0064OKADS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361747126&sr=8-1&keywords=carbonator)
bottle cap from my dad's homebrewing setup. He uses it to keep beer that
has been kegged and force-carbonated fresh for transport after it's
poured. Using this cap with a CO2 tank,
a regulator, and a gas line with a ball-lock valve, you can make your
own carbonated beverages for much cheaper than with a sodastream. The
upfront cost is a little higher, but you can also use this setup with a
couple other parts for a
kegerator.
